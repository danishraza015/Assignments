        "Q1. Explain the key features of Python that make it a popular choice for programming?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans:- Python's popularity as a programming language stems from several key features:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.\tReadability and Simplicity: Python's syntax is clear and straightforward, which makes it easy to read and write. This simplicity encourages good programming practices and helps new programmers learn quickly.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "2.\tVersatility: Python is a multi-paradigm language that supports procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming. This flexibility allows developers to choose the best approach for their specific tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.\tExtensive Libraries and Frameworks: Python boasts a vast ecosystem of libraries and frameworks, such as NumPy, pandas, TensorFlow, Flask, and Django, which facilitate various tasks from data analysis to web development and machine learning.\n",
        "\n",
        "4.\tCommunity Support: Python has a large and active community, which means abundant resources, documentation, and third-party modules are available. This community support helps troubleshoot issues and fosters collaboration.\n",
        "\n",
        "5.\tCross-Platform Compatibility: Python can run on various operating systems, including Windows, macOS, and Linux. This portability makes it a great choice for developing cross-platform applications.\n",
        "\n",
        "6.\tDynamic Typing: Python uses dynamic typing, which allows developers to write less code and be more flexible. Variables can change type, making the language adaptable and reducing the need for verbose declarations.\n",
        "\n",
        "7.\tStrong Integration Capabilities: Python can easily integrate with other languages (like C, C++, and Java) and technologies (like REST APIs), making it suitable for various applications and environments.\n",
        "\n",
        "8.\tRobust Data Handling: With libraries like pandas and NumPy, Python excels in data manipulation and analysis, making it a favourite for data science and machine learning projects.\n",
        "\n",
        "9.\tRapid Development: The combination of simplicity and powerful libraries allows developers to build and iterate on projects quickly, making Python ideal for startups and prototyping.\n",
        "\n",
        "10.\tSupport for Automation: Python is often used for scripting and automation tasks, which can streamline workflows and reduce repetitive tasks in various fields.\n",
        "\n",
        "These features contribute to Python’s strong adoption across diverse domains, from web development to data science and beyond.\n"

        "Ans:- Type casting in Python refers to the conversion of one data type into another. This is often necessary when you need to perform operations between different types or when you want to ensure that data is in the correct format for processing. Python provides several built-in functions to facilitate type casting.\n",
