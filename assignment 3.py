#Theory question
Q1 What is the difference between a function and a method in Python?

Ans In Python, functions and methods are both callable objects, but there is a key difference between them:

Function: A function is a block of code that is defined independently of any class and can be called on its own. It may or may not accept parameters and return a result.

Method: A method is a function that is defined inside a class and is associated with an object (or class). When a method is called, it implicitly passes the object (or class) it belongs to as its first parameter.

Example of a Function
A standalone function that isn't tied to any class:
"""

def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

# Calling the function
print(greet("Alice"))

"""Output:"""

Hello, Alice!

"""Example of a Method
A method defined inside a class:

class Greeter:
    def greet(self, name):
        return f"Hello, {name}!"

# Creating an object of the class
greeter = Greeter()

# Calling the method using the object
print(greeter.greet("Bob"))

Output:
"""

Hello, Bob!

"""Here, greet is a method in the Greeter class, and it is called using the instance (greeter). The instance is implicitly passed as the first argument (self), which refers to the instance itself.

Q2 Explain the concept of function arguments and parameters in Python.

Ans
In Python, parameters and arguments are terms used in the context of functions. They are key to how information is passed into functions.

Parameters: These are the variable names listed in the function definition. They act as placeholders for the values that will be passed to the function when it is called.

Arguments: These are the actual values you provide to the function when you call it. The arguments replace the parameters defined in the function when it is invoked.

Example:
"""

# Function definition with parameters a and b
def add(a, b):
    result = a + b
    return result

# Function call with arguments 5 and 3
sum_value = add(5, 3)
print(sum_value)  # Output: 8

"""In this example:
a and b are parameters of the add function.
5 and 3 are arguments passed to the function when it is called.
The function adds the two arguments and returns the result.
In summary:

Parameters are defined in the function.
Arguments are the actual values passed during the function call.

Q3 What are the different ways to define and call a function in Python?

Ans In Python, functions can be defined and called in various ways depending on their use case. Here are the different ways to define and call functions:

1. Regular Function Definition and Call
A function is defined using the def keyword followed by the function name and parentheses. The function can then be called by using its name followed by parentheses.

Example:
"""

def greet():
    return "Hello, World!"

# Calling the function
print(greet())  # Output: Hello, World!

"""2. Function with Parameters
Functions can take parameters to operate on. The values passed during the function call are known as arguments.

Example:
"""

def add(a, b):
    return a + b

# Calling the function with arguments
print(add(5, 3))  # Output: 8

"""3. Functions with Default Parameters
Functions can have default values for parameters. If an argument is not provided during the function call, the default value is used.

Example:
"""

def greet(name="Guest"):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

# Calling the function with and without an argument
print(greet())          # Output: Hello, Guest!
print(greet("Alice"))   # Output: Hello, Alice!

"""4. Keyword Arguments
While calling a function, you can pass arguments as keyword arguments, where the order doesn't matter since the parameter names are explicitly stated.

Example:
"""

def describe_person(name, age):
    return f"{name} is {age} years old."

# Calling the function using keyword arguments
print(describe_person(age=30, name="Bob"))  # Output: Bob is 30 years old.

"""5. Variable-Length Arguments
Python allows you to pass a variable number of arguments to a function using *args (for non-keyworded arguments) and **kwargs (for keyworded arguments).

*args: Accepts multiple positional arguments as a tuple.
**kwargs: Accepts multiple keyword arguments as a dictionary.
Example:
"""

def print_numbers(*args):
    for num in args:
        print(num)

# Calling the function with multiple arguments
print_numbers(1, 2, 3, 4)

def print_details(**kwargs):
    for key, value in kwargs.items():
        print(f"{key}: {value}")

# Calling the function with keyword arguments
print_details(name="Alice", age=25)

"""6. Lambda (Anonymous) Functions
Lambda functions are anonymous, one-liner functions defined using the lambda keyword. They are useful for short, simple functions that are used temporarily.

Example:
"""

# Defining a lambda function
square = lambda x: x * x

# Calling the lambda function
print(square(5))  # Output: 25

"""7. Higher-Order Functions
A higher-order function is a function that takes another function as an argument or returns a function. This allows for more functional programming patterns.

Example:
"""

def apply_function(f, value):
    return f(value)

# Calling with a lambda function
print(apply_function(lambda x: x ** 2, 4))  # Output: 16

"""8. Nested Functions
A function can be defined inside another function. The inner function is usually only accessible inside the outer function.

Example:
"""

def outer():
    def inner():
        return "Hello from the inner function!"
    return inner()

# Calling the outer function
print(outer())  # Output: Hello from the inner function!

"""9. Recursive Functions
A recursive function is one that calls itself. Be careful with recursion, as it requires a base case to avoid infinite loops.

Example:
"""

def factorial(n):
    if n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n - 1)

# Calling the recursive function
print(factorial(5))  # Output: 120

"""These are the primary ways to define and call functions in Python, giving you a flexible way to structure your code based on the needs of your program.

Q4 What is the purpose of the `return` statement in a Python function?

Ans The return statement in a Python function is used to exit the function and send back a value (or values) to the caller. It serves two main purposes:

Terminate the Function: When the return statement is encountered, the function immediately stops execution and control is returned to the point where the function was called.

Return a Value: The expression or value after the return keyword is returned as the result of the function. This value can be assigned to a variable, used in further calculations, or just displayed.

Here's a simple example:
"""

def add_numbers(a, b):
    return a + b

result = add_numbers(5, 3)
print(result)  # Output: 8

"""If no value is specified after return, the function returns None by default:"""

def do_nothing():
    return

print(do_nothing())  # Output: None

"""Q5 What are iterators in Python and how do they differ from iterables?

Ans
In Python, iterators and iterables are closely related concepts, but they are not the same. Here's the distinction:

1. Iterables
An iterable is any Python object that can return its elements one at a time, allowing you to loop over it (e.g., using a for loop). Some common examples of iterables are lists, tuples, strings, and dictionaries.

Definition: An object is iterable if it implements the __iter__() method (which returns an iterator) or if it has a sequence-like behavior (allowing you to iterate over its elements).

Examples of Iterables:

Lists: [1, 2, 3]
Strings: "hello"
Dictionaries: {"key": "value"}
Tuples: (1, 2, 3)
How to get an iterator from an iterable: You can convert an iterable to an iterator by passing it to the iter() function:
"""

my_list = [1, 2, 3]
iterator = iter(my_list)

"""2. Iterators
An iterator is an object that represents a stream of data. It produces one value at a time when you call the next() function on it.

Definition: An object is an iterator if it implements both the __iter__() method (which returns itself) and the __next__() method (which returns the next item in the sequence, or raises a StopIteration exception when there are no more items).

Key Methods:

__iter__(): Returns the iterator object itself.
__next__(): Returns the next value from the iterator and raises StopIteration when all values have been returned.
Example of an Iterator:


"""

my_list = [1, 2, 3]
iterator = iter(my_list)

print(next(iterator))  # Output: 1
print(next(iterator))  # Output: 2
print(next(iterator))  # Output: 3
print(next(iterator))  # Raises StopIteration

"""Key Differences Between Iterators and Iterables:
Iterables: These are objects you can iterate over (e.g., lists, tuples), but they do not necessarily keep track of their own state. You can get an iterator from them using iter().
Iterators: These are objects that keep state and know how to fetch their next value on demand using next(). They can only be iterated over once, because they produce items one by one.
Summary:
Iterable: An object that can return an iterator (e.g., a list, string, or file).
Iterator: An object that can be iterated over with next(), and it keeps track of where it is in the iteration process.

Q6 Explain the concept of generators in Python and how they are defined.

Ans
In Python, generators are a type of iterable, like lists or tuples, but they are more memory-efficient. Instead of generating all the values upfront and storing them in memory, generators yield one value at a time, making them ideal for working with large datasets or streams of data where loading everything into memory isn't feasible.

Key Features of Generators:
Lazy Evaluation: They produce items one at a time and only when asked for, which saves memory.
Iterator Protocol: Generators are iterators, meaning they can be used in a for loop or with functions like next().
Stateful Execution: Unlike functions that return a value and then end, a generator function remembers where it left off when yield is called, so it can resume from that point.
Defining a Generator
A generator is defined like a regular function, but instead of return, it uses the yield keyword. Here's an example:
"""

def my_generator():
    yield 1
    yield 2
    yield 3

"""This function doesn't return all the values at once. Instead, it "yields" them one at a time. You can iterate through this generator like this:"""

gen = my_generator()

print(next(gen))  # Outputs: 1
print(next(gen))  # Outputs: 2
print(next(gen))  # Outputs: 3

"""When next() is called on the generator, it resumes execution at the point where yield was last called, producing the next value.

Example: Generator to Produce a Sequence of Numbers
"""

def countdown(n):
    while n > 0:
        yield n
        n -= 1

"""Now, you can iterate over this generator in a loop:"""

for num in countdown(5):
    print(num)

"""for num in countdown(5):
    print(num)

"""

5
4
3
2
1

"""Generator Expression
Generators can also be created using a generator expression, which is similar to list comprehensions but uses parentheses instead of square brackets.

Example:
"""

gen_expr = (x * x for x in range(5))

for num in gen_expr:
    print(num)

"""This will output:"""

0
1
4
9
16

"""Advantages of Generators:
Memory efficiency: Since they yield items lazily, they don’t require the memory to store all elements at once.
Performance: In many cases, generators can be faster than equivalent list-based solutions when you only need a few values.
Infinite sequences: Generators are perfect for generating potentially infinite sequences, as they don’t store all values.
Generators are thus extremely useful when working with large data or streams where you want to maintain efficiency.

Q7 What are the advantages of using generators over regular functions?

Ans Using generators instead of regular functions offers several advantages, particularly in terms of memory efficiency, performance, and flexibility when handling large data sets or streams. Here's a breakdown of the key advantages:

1. Memory Efficiency
Lazy Evaluation: Generators compute values on demand. This means they generate values one at a time and yield them when requested, rather than calculating and storing all values at once (as a regular function would do by returning a list or another container).
No Need for Storing Data: Generators do not store the entire sequence in memory, making them ideal for working with large data sets or infinite sequences where storing all results would be impractical or impossible.
2. Improved Performance
Faster Initialization: Since a generator produces values only when needed, it can start generating results faster than a function that needs to prepare the entire collection before returning it. This reduces initial overhead and can make the program faster in scenarios where not all results are needed.
Avoid Unnecessary Computation: Generators only compute values that are consumed. If you're iterating through only part of the sequence, a generator won’t compute the rest of the values, saving computation time.
3. Pipelining
Generators allow you to process data in a pipeline. You can chain multiple generators together, where each generator takes input from the previous one and passes its output to the next. This creates an efficient, streaming data pipeline that processes items one at a time without ever storing large amounts of data in memory.
4. Statefulness and Pausing Execution
Maintain State: A generator function can maintain local variables between each call using the yield keyword. After yielding a value, the generator remembers the state where it left off, allowing it to resume exactly where it stopped.
Pause and Resume Execution: Regular functions run from start to finish when called. Generators, on the other hand, pause execution at each yield and resume from the same place on the next iteration.
5. Simpler Code for Iteration
Generators allow for cleaner and more concise code when handling large or complex sequences of data. Instead of manually managing an index or intermediate state, you can use yield to abstract away iteration logic.
6. Infinite Sequences
Generators are perfect for infinite sequences, where a regular function that returns a list would consume all memory. For example, you can write a generator that produces an infinite stream of numbers, dates, or other values without running into memory issues.
7. Interleaving I/O with Processing
Generators can yield control back to the caller during I/O operations, allowing for asynchronous-like behavior in some contexts. This is useful when interleaving I/O (like reading from a file) with data processing.
Example:
Regular Function:
"""

def get_squares(n):
    result = []
    for i in range(n):
        result.append(i * i)
    return result

squares = get_squares(10)
print(squares)  # Prints: [0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81]

"""Generator Function:"""

def get_squares_gen(n):
    for i in range(n):
        yield i * i

squares_gen = get_squares_gen(10)
for square in squares_gen:
    print(square)  # Prints squares one at a time

"""The generator example yields one value at a time, making it more efficient if you only need to process the values as they come, rather than storing them all at once.

Conclusion:
Generators are particularly advantageous when working with large datasets, when memory efficiency is crucial, or when you need to handle sequences of values progressively or on demand. They offer a powerful tool for efficient and flexible code design.

Q8  What is a lambda function in Python and when is it typically used?

Ans A lambda function in Python is an anonymous, small function defined using the lambda keyword. It can have any number of input parameters but only a single expression, which is evaluated and returned as the result. Lambda functions are typically used for short-term tasks where defining a full function with def would be overkill.

Syntax:
"""

lambda arguments: expression

"""Example:"""

# Lambda function that adds 10 to a number
add_10 = lambda x: x + 10
print(add_10(5))  # Output: 15

"""Here, lambda x: x + 10 is the lambda function that adds 10 to the input x.

Typical Use Cases for Lambda Functions:
As Arguments to Functions: They are commonly used with functions like map(), filter(), and sorted() where short, simple functions are required.
"""

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
# Using lambda with map to square each number
squared = list(map(lambda x: x ** 2, numbers))
print(squared)  # Output: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]

"""In Key Functions: Lambda functions are often used with sorting functions, like sorted(), to define custom sorting behavior."""

students = [('John', 85), ('Jane', 92), ('Dave', 78)]
# Sort by score using lambda
sorted_students = sorted(students, key=lambda student: student[1])
print(sorted_students)  # Output: [('Dave', 78), ('John', 85), ('Jane', 92)]

"""For Quick, Throwaway Functions: When you need a simple function for a short task that doesn't require reuse or a formal function definition."""

# Lambda to check if a number is even
is_even = lambda x: x % 2 == 0
print(is_even(4))  # Output: True

"""Key Features:
Anonymous: Lambda functions don't need a name, which is why they are often called "anonymous functions."
Single Expression: They can only contain a single expression, not multiple statements or complex logic.
Short-term Usage: Ideal for short, simple operations, especially as inline functions passed to higher-order functions.
They are not suitable for more complex logic, where traditional functions with the def keyword are more appropriate.

Q9  Explain the purpose and usage of the `map()` function in Python.

Ans The map() function in Python is used to apply a given function to all items in an iterable (such as a list, tuple, etc.) and return an iterator (in Python 3) that yields the results.

Purpose:
The primary purpose of map() is to perform an operation on every element of an iterable without using a for-loop. It simplifies code by eliminating the need to write an explicit loop, making the code more concise and often more readable.

Syntax:
"""

map(function, iterable)

"""function: A function that takes one or more arguments.
iterable: An iterable (e.g., list, tuple) that provides the elements on which the function will be applied.
Example Usage:
Single iterable example: Applying a function to each element of a list:
"""

def square(x):
    return x ** 2

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
result = map(square, numbers)
print(list(result))  # Output: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]

"""Using lambda functions with map(): You can simplify the function using lambda (anonymous function):"""

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
result = map(lambda x: x ** 2, numbers)
print(list(result))  # Output: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]

"""Multiple iterables: If the function takes more than one argument, you can pass multiple iterables. map() will apply the function by taking one element from each iterable at the same position."""

numbers1 = [1, 2, 3]
numbers2 = [4, 5, 6]
result = map(lambda x, y: x + y, numbers1, numbers2)
print(list(result))  # Output: [5, 7, 9]

"""Key Points:
map() returns an iterator, so you typically need to convert the result into a list (or another collection) to see the output.
The function passed to map() can be a predefined function, a lambda expression, or any callable object.
It is generally more efficient than a for loop when dealing with large datasets, since it returns a lazy iterator.

Q10 What is the difference between `map()`, `reduce()`, and `filter()` functions in Python?

Ans
In Python, the map(), reduce(), and filter() functions are used for functional programming, allowing you to apply functions to sequences (like lists, tuples, or sets). Here's a breakdown of their differences:

1. map()
Purpose: Transforms each element of a sequence based on a function.
Input: A function and one or more sequences (e.g., lists).
Output: A new sequence where each element is the result of applying the function to the corresponding element(s) of the input sequence(s).
Example:
"""

nums = [1, 2, 3, 4]
result = list(map(lambda x: x**2, nums))
print(result)  # Output: [1, 4, 9, 16]

"""2. reduce()
Purpose: Reduces a sequence to a single value by repeatedly applying a binary function (a function with two inputs).
Input: A function and a sequence.
Output: A single value obtained by combining the elements of the sequence.
Note: reduce() is in the functools module in Python 3, so you need to import it first.
Example:
"""

from functools import reduce
nums = [1, 2, 3, 4]
result = reduce(lambda x, y: x + y, nums)
print(result)  # Output: 10 (1 + 2 + 3 + 4)

"""3. filter()
Purpose: Filters elements of a sequence based on a predicate (a function that returns True or False).
Input: A function (predicate) and a sequence.
Output: A new sequence containing only the elements for which the predicate is True.
Example:
"""

nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
result = list(filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, nums))
print(result)  # Output: [2, 4] (only even numbers)

"""Summary of Differences:
map(): Transforms each element of a sequence.
reduce(): Combines all elements into a single value.
filter(): Selects elements based on a condition.
Each function is useful depending on the operation you want to perform on the sequence!

#PRACTICAL QUESTION
Q1 Write a Python function that takes a list of numbers as input and returns the sum of all even numbers in
the list.

Ans Here’s a Python function that takes a list of numbers as input and returns the sum of all even numbers:
"""

def sum_of_evens(numbers):
    return sum(num for num in numbers if num % 2 == 0)

# Example usage
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
result = sum_of_evens(numbers)
print("Sum of even numbers:", result)

"""This function uses a generator expression to iterate through the list and sum only the even numbers (those divisible by 2).

Q2 Create a Python function that accepts a string and returns the reverse of that string.

Ans Here's a Python function that accepts a string and returns its reverse:
"""

def reverse_string(s):
    return s[::-1]

"""For example, when given the input "hello world", the function returns "dlrow olleh". Let me know if you'd like to modify this further! ​[>_]

Q3  Implement a Python function that takes a list of integers and returns a new list containing the squares of
each number.

Ans Here’s a Python function that takes a list of integers and returns a new list containing the squares of each number:
"""

def square_numbers(numbers):
    return [num ** 2 for num in numbers]

# Example usage:
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
squared_numbers = square_numbers(numbers)
print(squared_numbers)  # Output: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]

"""This function uses list comprehension to create a new list where each number in the input list is squared.

Q4 Write a Python function that checks if a given number is prime or not from 1 to 200.

Ans Here’s a Python function that checks if a given number is prime, specifically for numbers in the range from 1 to 200:
"""

def is_prime(n):
    """Check if a number is prime."""
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

# Test the function for numbers from 1 to 200
for number in range(1, 201):
    if is_prime(number):
        print(f"{number} is a prime number.")
    else:
        print(f"{number} is not a prime number.")

"""Explanation:
The function is_prime(n) checks if n is a prime number:
It returns False if n is less than or equal to 1.
It checks divisibility from 2 to the square root of n to determine if n has any divisors other than 1 and itself.
The loop at the bottom tests all numbers from 1 to 200, printing whether each is prime or not.
You can run this code in any Python environment to see the results.

Q5 Create an iterator class in Python that generates the Fibonacci sequence up to a specified number of
terms.

Ans Here's a simple iterator class in Python that generates the Fibonacci sequence up to a specified number of terms. The class implements the iterator protocol by defining __iter__() and __next__() methods.
"""

class FibonacciIterator:
    def __init__(self, n):
        self.n = n  # Total number of terms to generate
        self.a, self.b = 0, 1  # Starting values of the Fibonacci sequence
        self.count = 0  # Counter to keep track of the number of generated terms

    def __iter__(self):
        return self  # The iterator object itself

    def __next__(self):
        if self.count < self.n:
            # Generate the next Fibonacci number
            fibonacci_number = self.a
            self.a, self.b = self.b, self.a + self.b  # Update values for the next iteration
            self.count += 1  # Increment the counter
            return fibonacci_number
        else:
            raise StopIteration  # Stop iteration when the specified number of terms is reached

# Example usage:
fibonacci_sequence = FibonacciIterator(10)  # Create an iterator for the first 10 Fibonacci numbers
for number in fibonacci_sequence:
    print(number)

"""Explanation:
Initialization (__init__): The class takes an integer n as an argument, which defines how many terms of the Fibonacci sequence will be generated. It initializes the first two Fibonacci numbers and a counter.

Iteration Methods:

__iter__(): Returns the iterator object itself.
__next__(): Checks if the number of generated terms is less than n. If so, it returns the next Fibonacci number and updates the values for the next term. If all terms have been generated, it raises StopIteration.
Example Usage: An instance of FibonacciIterator is created for the first 10 Fibonacci numbers, and a loop prints each generated number.

Feel free to modify the number of terms in the example usage!

Q6 Write a generator function in Python that yields the powers of 2 up to a given exponent.

Ans Certainly! Here's a Python generator function that yields the powers of 2 up to a specified exponent:
"""

def powers_of_two(exponent):
    for i in range(exponent + 1):
        yield 2 ** i

# Example usage:
for power in powers_of_two(5):
    print(power)

"""Explanation:
The function powers_of_two takes one argument, exponent.
It uses a for loop to iterate from 0 to exponent (inclusive).
For each iteration, it yields 2 ** i, which computes
2
2 raised to the power of
𝑖
i.
You can use the generator in a loop to print or process the powers of 2.
In the example usage, calling powers_of_two(5) will yield the following output:
"""

1
2
4
8
16
32

"""Q7  Implement a generator function that reads a file line by line and yields each line as a string.

Ans You can create a generator function in Python to read a file line by line using the yield statement. Here’s a simple implementation:
"""

def read_file_line_by_line(file_path):
    """Generator function to read a file line by line."""
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        for line in file:
            yield line.strip()  # Strip newline characters from each line

"""Usage
To use the generator function, you can iterate over it like this:
"""

file_path = 'your_file.txt'  # Replace with your actual file path
for line in read_file_line_by_line(file_path):
    print(line)

"""Explanation
The function read_file_line_by_line takes a file_path as an argument.
It opens the file in read mode ('r').
It iterates over each line in the file and yields it after stripping any leading or trailing whitespace, including newline characters.
You can call this generator in a loop, which will read the file lazily, yielding one line at a time without loading the entire file into memory.

Q8  Use a lambda function in Python to sort a list of tuples based on the second element of each tuple.

Ans You can use a lambda function in Python to sort a list of tuples by the second element of each tuple by utilizing the sorted() function. Here's an example:
"""

# Sample list of tuples
tuples_list = [(1, 'banana'), (2, 'apple'), (3, 'orange'), (4, 'grape')]

# Sorting the list of tuples based on the second element
sorted_list = sorted(tuples_list, key=lambda x: x[1])

# Output the sorted list
print(sorted_list)

"""Explanation:
sorted(): This function sorts the elements of an iterable.
key=lambda x: x[1]: This specifies that the sorting should be based on the second element of each tuple (x[1]).
Output:
The output of the code will be:
"""

[(2, 'apple'), (1, 'banana'), (4, 'grape'), (3, 'orange')]

"""This shows that the list is sorted alphabetically based on the fruit names.

Q9  Write a Python program that uses `map()` to convert a list of temperatures from Celsius to Fahrenheit.

Ans Here’s a simple Python program that uses the map() function to convert a list of temperatures from Celsius to Fahrenheit:
"""

# Function to convert Celsius to Fahrenheit
def celsius_to_fahrenheit(celsius):
    return (celsius * 9/5) + 32

# List of temperatures in Celsius
celsius_temperatures = [0, 20, 37, 100]

# Using map to convert the list of Celsius temperatures to Fahrenheit
fahrenheit_temperatures = list(map(celsius_to_fahrenheit, celsius_temperatures))

# Printing the results
print("Celsius Temperatures:", celsius_temperatures)
print("Fahrenheit Temperatures:", fahrenheit_temperatures)

"""Explanation:
Function: celsius_to_fahrenheit takes a temperature in Celsius and converts it to Fahrenheit using the formula
(
𝐶
×
9
5
)
+
32
(C×
5
9
​
 )+32.
List of Celsius temperatures: This is a predefined list that you can modify.
map() function: It applies the celsius_to_fahrenheit function to each element in the celsius_temperatures list.
Output: Finally, it prints both the original Celsius temperatures and the converted Fahrenheit temperatures.
You can run this code in a Python environment, and it will show you the converted temperatures.

Q10 Create a Python program that uses `filter()` to remove all the vowels from a given string.

Ans You can use the filter() function in Python to remove vowels from a given string. Here's a simple program that accomplishes this:
"""

def remove_vowels(input_string):
    vowels = 'aeiouAEIOU'  # Define vowels
    # Use filter to remove vowels
    filtered_string = ''.join(filter(lambda char: char not in vowels, input_string))
    return filtered_string

# Example usage
input_str = "Hello, World!"
result = remove_vowels(input_str)
print("Original String:", input_str)
print("String without Vowels:", result)

"""Explanation:
The remove_vowels function takes an input string and defines a string of vowels (both uppercase and lowercase).
The filter() function is used with a lambda function that checks if each character is not in the vowels string.
filter() returns an iterator, so we join the characters back into a single string using ''.join().
Finally, the program prints the original string and the modified string without vowels.
You can run this code, and it will remove all vowels from the provided string.

Write a Python program, which returns a list with 2-tuples. Each tuple consists of the order number and the
product of the price per item and the quantity. The product should be increased by 10,- € if the value of the
order is smaller than 100,00 €.

Write a Python program using lambda and map.

Ans To implement the accounting routine you described for a bookshop, we can create a Python program that processes a list of orders. Each order will contain an order number, a list of items (with price and quantity), and we will return a list of tuples containing the order number and the adjusted total for each order.

Here's a Python program that uses lambda and map to achieve this:
"""

# Sample list of orders
orders = [
    [1, [["Book A", 20.0, 3], ["Book B", 15.0, 2]]],
    [2, [["Book C", 50.0, 1], ["Book D", 20.0, 4]]],
    [3, [["Book E", 30.0, 1], ["Book F", 25.0, 2]]],
]

# Function to calculate the total for each order
def calculate_order_totals(orders):

"""Explanation:
Data Structure: The input is a list of orders, where each order consists of an order number and a list of items. Each item is represented by a list containing the item name, price per item, and quantity.

Lambda and Map:

We use map to apply a function to each order in the orders list.
The lambda function takes an order and calculates the total price for that order. It sums up the price multiplied by the quantity for each item in the order.
If the total is less than €100, we add €10 to the total.
Output: The result is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the order number and the calculated total price.

Output Example:
For the provided sample orders, the output will look something like this:
"""

[(1, 70.0), (2, 110.0), (3, 80.0)]

"""For order 1, the total is €70.00 (less than €100, so we add €10).
For order 2, the total is €110.00 (no extra charge).
For order 3, the total is €80.00 (less than €100, so we add €10).
Feel free to modify the sample data to test different scenarios!
